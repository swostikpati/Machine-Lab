## Topics I am interested in working

### NYU Abu Dhabi 4 year cycle

I feel there is no better time than the Spring IM showcase for this theme. A time that is so close to commencement. A tribute to all the classes that have graduated and the ones that shall come but specifically to the Class of 2024 - a class that entered at the height of the pandemic and will be graduating in a world that is hopefully post-pandemic. This installation would be a celebration of hope and nostalgia. The rite of passage of every NYU Abu Dhabi student. The excitement the moment you get your candidate weekend invite, to Marhaba when you finally get to see the campus that you have imagined every day from the last several months, to getting to study away in countries that 10 year old you would have never imagined you would visit, to finally ending at an high as you walk across the stage to receive your diploma as you commence the next chapter of your life.

### Greatest Games through the years

Video games are something that almost each one of us has some exporsure and connection to. It is a theme that is can be very engaging - especially when we are talking about the most popular games through time. The theme can support highly interactive projects and something that almost everyone can relate to.

The way the idea of the project came to my mind is when I thought about what to do with the empty space at the bottom of the clock. I thought about a loading bar that gets filled up from one side to the other as we move through the different ages of the games. This would be a very interesting way to show the passage of time and the evolution of games.

## 4 Projects under the theme: NYU Abu Dhabi 4 year cycle

1. Candidate Weekend
2. Marhaba
3. Study Away
4. Commencement

## Developing the Project: Commencement

### What would it depict?

This project is the last part in the theme of the NYUAD 4 Year cycle - The Commencement. It celebrates the graduation of the students from the class year.

### What materials will you use for each part?

- Motors, rubber, , etc for a continuous hidden conveyer belt
- Laser cut 2d figures as the other students
- 1 3d printed figure of the primary student wearing the graduation attire.
- Transparent strings to suspend the figures

### How would you animate anything moving?

- The conveyer belt would be moving continuously. This would allow the movement of the person through the stage and exit.
- We envision suspending the hats of the figures from the ceiling using transparent strings. In the end as the character exits, all the caps go up giving an illusion of them being thrown high up in the air.

### Will there be sound? What?

- The sound of the name of the person being called in pitch silnce as they start walking up the stage.
- The sound of the crowd cheering as the person walks across the stage.
- Super upbeat music starts playing combined with cheering and the sound of caps flying across the room.
- The music fades out as the person exits the stage.

### Will there be lights? (We have lots of NeoPixels.)

- Commencement generally happens in a super well lit room in colors of white and the classic NYU purple. We can use the neopixels to mimic the same.
- Might try for a high intensity beam of light on the person as they walk across the stage.

### Make a rough sketch, to the best of your ability.

### What mechanical/electronic components will you need?

- Servo motors
- DC motors
- Rubber belts
- Gears
- Pulleys
- Speakers
- LED's
- Thin Metal rods/plates

### Draw a block diagram showing very roughly how these components are connected. You don't need to show the circuit or specific wires, just in general what is connected to what.

### What tools or equipment or skills will you need?

- Metal CNC'ing
- Laser Cutting
- 3d printing
- Soldering
