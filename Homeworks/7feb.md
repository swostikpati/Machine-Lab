## Initial Overall Plan

- Have a draft layout for the project space after we are are aware of the project dimensions and the time we spend on each project in each iteration of the clock (number of minutes spend per hour).
- Learn how to make electomagnets work especially for propulsion of the rollercoaster.
- Think about the material we would use for the tracks and wheels.
- Envision how the rollercoaster itself would look like:
  - How many cars?
  - How would the cars look like?
  - How would the cars be connected?
  - Storing the different electrical components in the cars.
- Think about how the track would look like:
  - Like having an incline or slope?
  - Maybe a loop?
- Think about how to track the position of our rollercoaster:
  - putting small switches (copper tape) at different points on the track to complete a circuit.
  - if the first idea doesn't work, we can use IR sensors/other sensors to track the positions

## Most frightening element

The most frighteneing element of this project is just initially making a wheel chassis run on a track using electromagnets. If we are to get this right, the rest of our project would be to replicate it and adjusting the power supply.

## Rough Sketch of our most frightening element

## Questions

- How do we make the electromagnets work for our track and our rollercoaster?
- How much time does each project run in an hour?
- Is there a possibility of adding maglev to our rollercoasters? (super ambitious but would be super cool if we could pull it off)
