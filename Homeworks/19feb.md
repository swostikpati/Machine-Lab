## Electrification of Tracks

- car would not be solely dependent on gravity
- forgo the use of magnets (first prototype had issues)
- potentially forgo use of conveyer belt
- allow for more uniform rollercoaster track

## Execution

- small wooden frame with two motors
- arduino is stationary on the ground controlling electricity into the track, this way disconnections are prevented
- speed can be controlled using varying voltage
- if motor disconnects, car has enough momentum to keep moving until motor reconnects

## Take-Aways

- copper strips led to disconnections
- motors need to be in parallel
- speed was satisfactory
- motors led to disconnections

## Resolution of Disconnection

- instead of having the entire copper strip setup, we would run two parallel lines (+ and -) in the track itself using denser stranded/solid wire
- there would be another set of wires underneath the rollercoaster that would make constant contact with the wires on the track and that would ensure that there are least possible disconnections
