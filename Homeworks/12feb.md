# Rollercoaster Project Documentation - Homework: 12 February

## Project Overview

This document outlines our progress, challenges, and future plans in building a small rollercoaster prototype. Our focus was on getting a component to move using a motor, addressing the challenges of mechanical attachment and motion control.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Motor Attachment and Control

- **Motor Heating:** Noted significant heating of the motor during operation, raising concerns about its durability and safety.
- **Securing the Motor:** We found that completely stabilizing and securing the motor and the belt's tension was critical. The belt needs to be very tight for consistent motion.

### Track and Car Design

- **Magnet Strength and Placement:** The need for a stronger magnet, or one that covers more surface area, became apparent. This adjustment aims to enhance the rollercoaster car's adherence to the track.
- **Track Incline:** We observed the rollercoaster car falling off near the top of the incline, suggesting a need to lessen the track's incline.
- **Magnet Polarity:** Matching the polarity of magnets was crucial to avoid repulsion. Initially, multiple magnets caused the car to stick to various places unintentionally. We decided to proceed with a single magnet for the prototype.
- **Positioning:** Experimented with different positions for the top thing until we found one that worked best. We also had to cut holes to allow the motor and the belt to be closer to the incline, improving the overall mechanism.

### Modifications

- **External Magnet Placement:** Through testing, we discovered that placing the magnet outside the car ensured better performance than an internal setup.
- **Prototype Adjustments:** Encountered issues with the car's orientation and movement, leading to the decision to use just one magnet for the time being.

## Future Plans

- **Stabilization and Motion:** Ensuring the car does not spin and investigating ways to make the car slide forward instead of backwards.
- **Magnetic System:** Intending to add multiple magnets, after finding ways to prevent the car from sticking to unintended magnets.
- **Electrification:** Exploring the possibility of electrifying the track to provide power to the coaster, aiming for a more efficient propulsion method.
